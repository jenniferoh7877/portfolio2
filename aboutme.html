  <p>   Some of the similarities are that they both share most of the operators and the different events. For example, they both have the pen up and pen down command. Some differences are that Python is much easier to work with because I didn't have to keep looking for blocks that I was looking forand I was able to just type in what I wanted the turtle to do in Python. </p>
  <p2>   I made some spelling mistakes and I also used a semicolon instead of a colon. Little mistakes were hard to detect. But at the same time I liked how I have more freedom to make the turtle to do what I wanted. </p>

  <p3> I liked how we were able to be creative in the way that they plot goes with Text Adventure. I love Python so much better than scratch. Also I loved the college talk that we had but I get very overwhelmed and nervous about the whole process and I don't have a college counselor in my school so I don't know who to go to for help. But for sure, the guest speaker helped a lot with me being nervous. </p3>
